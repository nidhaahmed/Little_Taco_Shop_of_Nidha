## About LTS

The Little Taco Shop, founded in 2022, is a place built from a love of tacos. We aim to add a unique and interesting flavor to our little town.

### Taco Trivia

Did you know? Tacos first appeared in the United States in 1905. Mexican migrants introduced this delicious and portable street food while working on railroads and other jobs ([Source](https://www.twistedtaco.com/the-history-of-the-taco)).
